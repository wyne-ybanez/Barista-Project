        If you have a quick look at our menu, you can see that we have a wide range of foods and drinks. Being from Cork, we have a range of local products such as Ballymary relish, Glenilal yoghurts and our eggs are from a farm in west cork.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-2">
        There are a lot of food and drink options, however, which are clearly not of local recipe. As a family we have travelled through Asia, Africa and the US to find our favourite drinks and confectionery. Feel free to broaden your horizon with us and try some of our exotic food and drinks!
