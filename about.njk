        About Us
      </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-1">
        If you have a quick look at our menu, you can see that we have a wide range of foods and drinks. Being from Cork, we have a range of local products such as Ballymary relish, Glenilal yoghurts and our eggs are from a farm in west cork.      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-2">
        There are a lot of food and drink options, however, which are clearly not of local recipe. As a family we have travelled through Asia, Africa and the US to find our favourite drinks and confectionery. Feel free to broaden your horizon with us and try some of our exotic food and drinks!

          Run by an Irish family, UB20 was opened in January of 2020. With the start of a new
          decade, he had great plans for the year ahead and for our new home. Unfortunately, the world came to a stop and so did ours with COVID-19. We closed our doors in late February and our future was looking dim. But, thanks to you, we have made it back. It was a difficult journey but your help has made it possible. From serving from our doorstep to finally starting a delivery service in July, our customers have supported us greatly. Today, we are back in full swing and have a wide range of drinks and confectionery for all to enjoy. Come in to us on Teapot Alley and say hi between 8am and 8pm Monday-Saturday.

        Our Journey!
      </h1>
     <p class="paragraph-1">
        Over the past couple of years, our world has gone through the ringer. In late 2020, once we were able to afford it, we began to set aside 20% of our earnings to give to charities involved in relief for people in vulnerable communities going through this pandemic. Such charities include; Catholic Aid, International Plan, Self Aid Africa and World View.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-2">
        Along with the SARS CoV2 pandemic, we have also helped out in other tragedies around the world, in 2021 alone we donated â‚¬50,000 to charity to aid natural disasters such as the wildfires in Greece and Turkey, the earthquake in Haiti and Hurricane Ida in the US.
